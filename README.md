# Churn & Loan Prediction Project

## Overview
This project combines customer churn and loan datasets to build prediction models for loan status and customer churn. The dataset was cleaned and merged, followed by the development of machine learning models. A dynamic Power BI dashboard was also created to visualize key metrics and trends.

## Project Highlights
- **Data Cleaning & Merging:** Combined and cleaned the customer churn and loan datasets using **Python** and **Google Colab**.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Trained and evaluated models to predict customer churn and loan status with high accuracy.
- **Power BI Dashboard:** Created an interactive dashboard for visualizing key metrics and trends in the dataset.

## Key Deliverables
- **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**
- **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
- **Functional Requirements Document (FRD)**
- **Gap Analysis Report**
- **Use Case Document**
- **Machine Learning Project Report**
- **Power BI Report** (Interactive Visuals for Performance & Engagement Trends)

## Skills and Tools Used
- **Python** (Data Cleaning, Machine Learning, Model Evaluation)
- **Power BI** (Dashboard Design and Visualization)
- **Google Colab** (Environment for Running Python Code)
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- **Data Visualization** (Charts, Graphs, and Interactive Reports)
- **Business Analysis** (Requirements Documentation, Gap Analysis)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-loan-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to see the data cleaning, model training, and dashboard creation.

## Conclusion
This project has been a valuable learning experience, blending data analysis, machine learning, and business insights to solve real-world problems. It highlights my ability to work with large datasets, build predictive models, and present findings in an interactive format.
